    1). What are the new tags added in HTML5?

 -> HTML5 is an upgraded version of HTML 4.01. New elements are added in HTML5 to write easy and fast code to 
    create complex, dynamic, engaging, and effective websites. These new elements add advanced functional features, 
    improvised page layouts, and other improvements. The commonly used new HTML5 tags are <figure>, <article>, <header>, 
    <main>,<footer>, <nav>, and <section>.

    2). How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
 -> Add <audio> and <video> elements to the page; make them display the default browser controls. 
    Give both of them <source> elements so that browsers will find the audio format they support best 
    and load it. These should include type attributes. 

    3). Semantic element in HTML5?
 -> A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.  
    Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
    Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

    Semantic Elements in HTML:
    <article>, <aside>, <details>, <figcaption>, <figure>, <footer>, <header>, 
    <main>, <mark>, <nav>, <section>, <summary>, <time>

    4). Canvas and SVG tags
 -> SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML. Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly 
    (with a JavaScript). SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. 
    You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element. In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object.
