   • What is JavaScript?

It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web           technologies, two of      which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning      Area.

     Infinity is a property of the global object. In other words, it is a variable in global scope.

     JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
        for - loops through a block of code a number of times
        for/in - loops through the properties of an object
        for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
        while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
        do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

   • How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
